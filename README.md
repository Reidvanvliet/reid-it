# üëì Reid It Web App
[Reid It Application hosted by Netlify](https://reidit.netlify.app/)


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes 

**API Limitations** I have used the .JSON call without OAuth

 - The API will only return **25** posts at one time
 - The API can only display a limited number of comments and replies
 - The API can only display a limited number of communities
 
## üéØ Functionality

- View the top 25 "best of Reddit" post  
- Search "best of Reddit" posts by title
- Navigate to the top 25 communities and view the newest 25 posts

- Upvote and downvote posts and comments (this is restricted to visual only)
