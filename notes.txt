Have to make a search function that filters the titles by term

Make a side bar menu where the login thing is that sorts the posts by communities.

(use PetFinder for reference)

I have to fixe the comments from rendering when the api cuts off the reply train.

I have to allow the comments section to handle a gif reply.

It might be a good idea to have the comments render HTML instead but i havent seen a comment with that in it.
