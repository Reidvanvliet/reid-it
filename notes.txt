    implimentation

        search page render component
        -you will have to turn both the search term and post.title toLower so its not case sensitive
        -use map to map through the posts and if post.title "includes()" the given search term store the object in a new array

        search component in nav bar

        -


Make a side bar menu where the login thing is that sorts the posts by communities.

Comment cards are too bulky. Get rid of some padding.

I have to fixe the comments from rendering when the api cuts off the reply train.

I have to allow the comments section to handle a gif reply.

It might be a good idea to have the comments render HTML instead but i havent seen a comment with that in it.
