Comment cards are too bulky. Get rid of some padding.

I have to fixe the comments from rendering when the api cuts off the reply train.

I have to allow the comments section to handle a gif reply.

It might be a good idea to have the comments render HTML instead but i havent seen a comment with that in it.

*do this now*
have to style the open and close communities button
try to add the community avatar to the left
make the community button filter the main posts by community (make them all a link to community:{community})
